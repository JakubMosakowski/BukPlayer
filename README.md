# BukPlayer
Simple android audiobook mp3 player

### The idea

Imagine that you have many audiobooks ripped from CDs or downloaded from the Internet and you are
too lazy for: manually copying them using a USB cable and then deleting them from your phone when you finish. 
The idea for the BukPlayer is to give you the ability to listen to your private audiobooks collection anywhere.

Steps: 
1. Put your audiobooks in some folder 
2. Execute the [script](tree/master/scripts) which generates required JSON files
3. Upload your files to some web server / online storage
4. Install BukPlayer app and enter URL to your files
5. Listen and have fun with your audiobook collection
